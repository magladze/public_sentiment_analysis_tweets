# TinyBert Training through KD and NLP augmentation methods

Training TinyBert using KD (Knowledge Distillation) and NLP (Natural Language Processing) Augmentation refers to a technique where a smaller and more computationally efficient version of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, known as TinyBert, is trained using knowledge distillation and NLP augmentation methods.

Here's a breakdown of the key components involved:

1. ## TinyBert: 
    - TinyBert is a compact version of the BERT model, which is a pre-trained transformer-based model widely used for various NLP tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, and more. 
    - TinyBert aims to provide a more lightweight alternative to the original BERT model while maintaining good performance on NLP tasks.

2. ## Knowledge Distillation (KD): 
    - Knowledge distillation is a technique used to transfer knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher model) to a smaller, more efficient model (student model). 
    - In this context, the knowledge learned by the original BERT model can be distilled into TinyBert through a teacher-student learning process, where TinyBert learns to mimic the behavior and predictions of the larger BERT model.

3. ## NLP Augmentation: NLP augmentation involves enhancing the training data for NLP models by applying various data augmentation techniques. These techniques can include adding noise to the input data, paraphrasing sentences, introducing synonyms, or generating new samples to improve the robustness and generalization of the model.

    - By combining knowledge distillation with NLP augmentation techniques, the goal is to train TinyBert in a more efficient and effective manner, leveraging the knowledge from the larger BERT model and augmenting the training data to enhance the model's performance on NLP tasks.
